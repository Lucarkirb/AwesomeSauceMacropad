# AWESOME SAUCE MACROPAD

The best worst macropad I have ever made, for the world to see. 
Runs custom firmware that will support almost infinite layers, macros, and maybe even AHK support?


## What the hell is it?
It's a Seeed studio xiao rp2040 macro pad designed like a madman, with custom firmware thats coming real soon. 

## Can I get it? 
Go order it yourself, tho pcba is going to get pricy since the neo pixels are costly to handle in a factory. Luckily they are super easy to hand solder.

Currently, the project is still being manufactured as im writing this. so stay tuned.
