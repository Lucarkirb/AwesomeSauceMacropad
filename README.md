# AWESOME SAUCE MACROPAD

The best worst macropad I have ever made, for the world to see. 
Runs custom firmware that will support almost infinite layers, macros, and maybe even AHK support?


## What the hell is it?
It's a Seeed studio xiao rp2040 macro pad designed like a madman, with custom firmware thats coming real soon. 
The layout is a 3x3 + an extra 3 button thumb cluster that lets you add more common keys like layer shifters or modifiers. It also has an encoder that can work as what you want but also allows you to interact with the firmwares settings, along with an OLED display to do your bidding.

Currently, the project is a mess as the thing requires the KY-040 encoder breakout board instead of just an smt encoder and also requires a generic i2c oled screen you get for your arduinos.

## Can I get it? 
Go order it yourself, tho pcba is going to get pricy since the neo pixels are costly to handle in a factory. Luckily they are super easy to hand solder.

Currently, the project is still being manufactured as im writing this, and thus i dont have any way to write firmware. Stay tuned.
